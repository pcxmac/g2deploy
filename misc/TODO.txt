INTEGRATE THE ESYNC.SH script in to the functionality of this stuff
TURN THE PROGRAM IN TO PYTHON
REVAMP SOURCE CONTROL, use conventions like rsync:/// file:/// ..., all source locations need to become URLs. 
REVAMP MIRROS AND A SCORING SYSTEM

		per major version

	need to incorporate firewall

	need to get rid of 'double login - gdm'
		~research issue, could be a normal thing
		video driver issue ? qxl /?

	ADD SWAP support via 
		zfs create -V 8G -b $(getconf PAGESIZE) -o logbias=throuput -o sync=always -o primarycache=metadata -o com.sun:auto-snapshot=false POOL/DATASET
		mkswap -f /dev/zvol/POOL/DATASET
		swapon /dev/zvol/POOL/DATASET
		{FSTAB} ::  /dev/zvol/POOL/DATASET   none   swap   discard  0 0

	enable SSHD

* eventually incorporate this function in to a dom-0 (spawn)

	.crypt
	[CRYPT] function
		pair w/ vpn 
		key management (gpg)
		domain key management (letsencrypt)

	.pkg
	[PKG] function
		sync service		- rsync
		distfile repo		- rsync
		binpkg	service		- mapped file system

	.proxy
	PROXY (web queries, wget, curl) 50-100GB	
	/etc/wgetrc (https/ftp/https_proxy)
	
	.dns
	.dhcp
	DNS	[ iface . container . subdomain . domain . tld ]
	DHCP 
		all subdomains ie VMs or physical machines are controlled by the dom-0
		all containers+ will be managed by the subdomain, all IPs are arbitrary, and change dynamically
		all names are remapped regularly, all names are linked to MAC rules (not literal MACs) 
		DNS queries have to be secure inside a domain (encrypted, before tunnel)
		DHCP has to be encrypted as well, certificates help authenticate the issuer


	.email
	EMAIL (POP3S/IMAPS), FORWARD (SMTP)

		dom0.email connects to smtp service some where. smtp servers are employed arbitrarily, dom0 holds email in a 
		secure repo
