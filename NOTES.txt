certificate is valid, if trying to use ssh, no password
system rebooted/refreshed doesn't do anything

added fuse/udev-root group

it appears the issue is with automount invoking spawn_mount

sshfs did not include sys-fs/fuse as a dependency.

not sure if sshfs or fuse should find a way to ignore the -n flag

i am replacing libfuse in /usr/lib64/ as well as fusermount3 in /usr/bin (sys-fs/fuse)
mount.fuse3: /usr/sbin/mount.fuse3 /usr/share/man/man8/mount.fuse3.8.bz2
fusermount3: /usr/bin/fusermount3 /usr/share/man/man1/fusermount3.1.bz2
17377:/usr/lib64/libfuse3.so.3.12.0

changed mount.c ()
    FUSE_OPT_KEY("n",               KEY_MTAB_OPT),


STRACE -

libmount (fuse) calls sshfs (sshfs),
