move users to ./config ???
or just run a auth service ...

change key at the end of the install doesn't work as it appears the mounts are un'd.

how to score repos : 

    rate downloaded = x1 (GB)/transfer  ... higher rates indicate more interesting and fulfilling repo transactions
    speed downloaded = x2 (MBPS) ... higher rates indicate higher availability
    reliability = x3 (uptime percentage) ... higher rates indicate higher availability
    frequency used = x4 (times / week) ... preferably less than 2 times. depends on network availability tho
        ... indicative of distribution density

how to score network

    hosts ... cumulative speed downloaded

    hosts ... reliability, mean deviation

    hosts ... spread_use, std deviation ... how distributed is the network utilized, ie, very much a few and very less a alot ... or very much a lot, and very less a few...

    USE YAML FILE TO GAUGE AVAILABILITY, AND PERFORMANCE OF NETWORK

    only list under 'protocols' if ever there was the ability to measure the service performance, otherwise, it will not be listed, however, it can be 'sensed' using a probe.

how to score aggregate network effect

*requires multiple hosts to distribute all results.
