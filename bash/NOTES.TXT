NEED TO DO. CHECK patches()

develop wget -r alternative for rsync fixed patch files
use legitimate offset for script to source the configs feeding the individual file patches

fix the boot= so that it accounts for realized partition names, and not assumed partition names {X}# where as this one is {X}p#


	OBSERVATIONS
	
	userflags for chromium and vscode are bunkem
	
	invalid transitions /dev, owned by portage, on boot (from deploy.sh)
	
	no networking devices like virbr0
