	match ?

	remainder ?

	column pointer ?

	listing ?

	

	remove, -r

		target = whole path - key/value pair (branch)
		value = trivial

		function - work in to listing, ignore the whole path and any decendents, only escape ignore
					as soon as the column pointer is equal or less than the desired target path



	insert, -i

		target = prefix path
		value = new key value pair
		
		function - scan through target directory, if no key found, insert new key value pair at end.


	modify, -m

		target = whole path, requires exact key/value pair match

		syntax for modification = path/to/key:value_pair:new_value_pair


	if not listing, and there is a partial match (w/ respect to cursor/column pointer) ++cp ; refresh cursor
