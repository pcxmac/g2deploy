# if root = \0 then list items should be permitted on the root level, path would = '/item_key:value/...'
# if there is not a root listing, there would be at least one node, and thus path would = 'root_node/...'
# the difference between list items, and regular items, is nill. They are treated exactly the same. The use of '/-' to list out, key-values under a prefix is valid
# yamlStd will normalize all tabs/spaces
